## Preface
Years had passed since they had successfully nurtured the small green plant back to life. Earth was showing signs of healing, but it was still burdened by vast heaps of discarded trash and pollution. WALL-E and EVE knew that their work was far from over. One day, as they explored a particularly polluted area, the idea struck them like lightningâ€”why not create a Mobile robotic to clean up the planet more efficiently? With WALL-E's resourcefulness and EVE's advanced technology, they set out to design the ultimate solution: the Autonomous Planet Cleaner (APC). The APC was a marvel of innovation, equipped with powerful vacuuming systems, waste sorting mechanisms, and state-of-the-art sensors.

## Task 7.1: Cytron Cleaner
### About
To enhance the cleaning efficiency and waste collection capabilities of the Autonomous Planet Cleaner (APC) machine, WALL-E and EVE embarked on the development of a specialized component: a high-performance DC brushed suction system.

### Output
- Developed the software to control the DC Brushed Motor using Cytron with Arduino.
- Implemented a software soft start filter using Exponential smoothing Filter..

### Task 7.2: Magic of PID
### About
In our pursuit of greater automation and precision in the cleaning process for the Autonomous Planet Cleaner (APC) machine, we have recognized the immense potential of incorporating a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm.

### Output
- Implemented PID control to regulate the suction mechanism to clean at a rate of 90 CFM (cubic feet per meter).

### Task 7.3: Hero of Mobility
### About
Recognizing the need for improved mobility and maneuverability in the ongoing mission to clean and restore the planet, WALL-E and EVE jointly decided to integrate omni wheels into the design of the Autonomous Planet Cleaner (APC).

### Output
- Derived the kinematic model for the wheel configuration.
- Created a Python simulation of the robot's movement, including the calculation of angular velocities for each motor.
- Implemented positional PID control for navigation.
- (BONUS) Developed a function to convert from the local frame of the robot to the global frame of the world using a rotational matrix.
